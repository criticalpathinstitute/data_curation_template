Move any existing CSV data tables to V1 folder.

If there are single table data files that are not CSV (e.g., Excel, TSV), convert them to CSV in the Workspace.
- This could be done in R or in Libre Office in the VM or any other way.
- Add a comment to this issue saying how you did the conversion and if you made any other manual changes.
- Store output in V1 folder
