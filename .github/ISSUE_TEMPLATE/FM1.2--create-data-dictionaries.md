All tabular datasets going into FAIR must have a data dictionary.

Some data tables will have existing dictionaries, but some will need to be created.
- All dictionaries must be CSV files. Convert existing files if necessary.
- Data dictionary column headings should follow Will's requirements (TODO: Will to update this step)
   - create column for table name if it does not exist.

Document your steps for creating dicitonaries in this issue.
